# Breast-Cancer-Classification-Using-Neural-Network

<h2>Project Overview</h2>j2>
Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer affecting women worldwide. Early detection and accurate diagnosis are crucial for effective treatment and improved survival rates. This project aims to develop a machine learning model using a neural network to classify breast cancer tumors as either benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous) based on various features.

<h2> Key Features of the Repository</h2>
<ul>
  <p><h4>Data Preprocessing:</h4> Includes scripts for loading, cleaning, and preprocessing the data to ensure that it is suitable for training a neural network model.</p>
  <p><h4>Model Building:</h4> Uses TensorFlow and Keras to create a neural network with multiple layers. The model is designed to classify the tumor based on input features, using activation functions, dropout layers, and optimization techniques to enhance performance.</p>
  <p><h4>Training and Evaluation:</h4> mplements training routines with hyperparameter tuning, loss function selection, and evaluation metrics to measure the model's accuracy and loss. The performance is validated using a separate test dataset.</p>
  <p><h4>Documentation:</h4> A well-organized README file with setup instructions, usage examples, and results.</p>
